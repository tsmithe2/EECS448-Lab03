        <p>
            My name is Harry Potter, and I am a wizard! I have spent several years
            studying magic at the university of Hogwarts. During my time there, many 
            times, I was confronted by Voldemort. I managed to reduce him to ashes
            in my "seventh year". It wasn't really a true year of school, considering
            that I spent the whole time finding and destroying hoarcruxes! I fell in
            love with Jinny Weasly after finishing school at Hogwarts. We now have two
            kids, and life couldn't be any better! After all, there's no way Voldemort
            could possibly return. There isn't even another dark wizard out there to
            stir up any trouble. At least, I don't think there is.
